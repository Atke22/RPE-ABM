- OPINION EVOLUTION IN CLOSED COMMUNITY - KATARZYNA SZNAJD-WERON

	- https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/S0129183100000936

	- Describes the Sznajd model for agent based opinion spreading built on the Ising model. It's an approach different from ours, but may be inspirational.

	- https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1207/s15327957pspr1001_3

	- Review paper of Prediction error modelling and its implementations. Also shows some mathematical basis, but that might not be suited for opinion spreading.

	- Basic agent-based model for opinion spreading. Could be useful for inspiration.

	- Another agent-based model of opinion spreading, in a network scenario. This one focusses on the spreading of unpopular opinions.
	
	
-The Social Dynamics of Expectations:The Interaction of Collective and Actor-Specific Expectations on Electronic Commerce and
Interactive Television

	-https://www.utwente.nl/en/bms/steps/staff/Konrad_2006.pdf
	
	-Using examples, explains how high expectation combined with satisfactory product provides a "protected space" from dissapointment.  If the product is not above this threshold, agents re-evaluate the outcome with their own expectation.  If collective expectations are low enough, the protected space may be lost and project cancelled (less distribution of movie).  


## Network Reformation

- Coevolution of agents and networks: Opinion spreading and community 
disconnection - Santiago Gil, Dami√°n H. Zanette

	- https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037596010600418X

	- Discusses how agents can affect each other opinions and even 
how a network-based model may change the network over time based on 
similar opinions.
